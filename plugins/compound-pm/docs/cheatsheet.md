# Compound PM — Cheat Sheet

## First Time Setup
```
/pm:welcome              # Guided first-run experience
/pm:onboard              # Create your PM profile
/pm:context              # Load your work environment
```

## The Core Loop
```
/pm:research             # Ingest customer signals (support, NPS, sales, usage)
/pm:interview            # Prepare → Interview → Debrief → Synthesize
/pm:opportunity          # Signal → Problem → Business context → HMW
/pm:solution             # 20 creativity techniques → Risk/Impact → Classification
/pm:spec                 # Vision narrative → Journey → Metrics → Launch criteria
/pm:review               # 5 agents review in parallel → P1/P2/P3 findings
/pm:measure              # Predictions → Activation funnel → Continue/Pause/Pivot
/pm:compound             # Predictions vs actuals → Profile update → Team share
```

## Anytime Commands
```
/pm:decide               # Options → Criteria → Pre-mortem → Log
/pm:buyin                # Stakeholder-specific narratives (6 techniques)
/pm:product-review       # Weekly review for team / leadership / all-hands
/pm:context update       # Refresh your operating environment
/pm:share                # Promote a learning to team knowledge base
/pm:lfg                  # Full pipeline: opportunity → buyin (one command)
```

## Three Files That Matter
```
pm-profile.yaml          # How YOU think (auto-enriched by /pm:compound)
team-profile.yaml        # What the TEAM knows (built by /pm:share)
work-context.yaml        # What you're WORKING ON (refreshed by /pm:context)
```

## Where Things Live
```
docs/research/interviews/    # Interview notes
docs/research/signals/       # Signal analysis
docs/research/synthesis/     # Cross-interview patterns
docs/opportunities/          # Evaluated opportunities
docs/solutions/              # Solution analyses
docs/specs/                  # Product specifications
docs/measurements/           # Predictions + actuals
docs/decisions/              # Decision logs
docs/compounds/              # Learnings (institutional knowledge)
docs/narratives/             # Stakeholder narratives
docs/reviews/                # Product reviews
```

## The One Rule
```
Never skip /pm:compound. That's where the gains accumulate.
```

## Weekly Rhythm
```
Monday:     /pm:context update → /pm:product-review
Anytime:    /pm:interview → /pm:research → /pm:opportunity
Big calls:  /pm:decide → /pm:buyin
Friday:     /pm:product-review → /pm:compound
```

## Personalization Compounds
```
Cycle 1:   Generic frameworks. Predictions are guesses.
Cycle 5:   Pre-filled thresholds. Past patterns referenced.
Cycle 10:  Estimation bias known. Past failures flagged.
Cycle 20:  Second brain knows more than you consciously remember.
```
