# Vision Narrative Skill

## Purpose

Write vision narratives that make people feel the problem and believe in the solution. A great vision is detailed, opinionated, and user-centric.

## The 3-Part Structure

### Part 1: The Aspirational Problem

**Goal:** Make the reader feel the pain.

**Techniques:**
- Start with a specific user in a specific moment
- Use numbers to make the scale visceral ("12 apps. 47 clicks. 1 simple question.")
- Show the emotional cost, not just the functional cost
- Make it personal — the reader should think "that's me" or "that's my customer"

**Template:**
> [Persona] sits at their [context]. They need to [simple goal]. But today, that means [painful current process]. This happens [frequency], costing [quantified impact].

**Example:**
> Maria manages a factory floor of 200 workers. When someone needs to swap a shift, they walk to the break room, find the paper schedule, write a note, and hope their manager sees it before tomorrow. This happens 30 times a week across her facility. Last month, 12 shifts went unfilled because the note was missed.

### Part 2: The Opinionated Solution

**Goal:** Show a specific, confident vision of how things should work.

**Techniques:**
- Walk through the user journey step by step
- Be specific about interactions ("they tap," "they see," "within 3 seconds")
- Show how each pain point from Part 1 is resolved
- Be opinionated — don't hedge with "could" or "might"

**Template:**
> With [solution], [persona] [specific action]. [The system] [specific response]. In [timeframe], they've [achieved outcome] — what used to take [old time] now takes [new time].

**Example:**
> With the Shift Hub, a worker taps their badge at the kiosk, sees available swaps matching their skills and schedule, and claims one in two taps. Their manager gets an instant notification. The shift is filled in 90 seconds — what used to take 24 hours and three people now happens before the worker finishes their coffee.

### Part 3: The User-Centric Resolution

**Goal:** Paint the world after the problem is solved.

**Techniques:**
- Zoom out from the individual to the organization
- Show cascading benefits (user → team → business)
- End with an aspirational statement about what becomes possible
- Connect back to the business outcome

**Template:**
> For [persona], this means [personal benefit]. For [their organization], it means [organizational benefit]. And for us, it means [business outcome]. [Aspirational closing statement].

**Example:**
> For Maria, this means she stops losing sleep over unfilled shifts. For her facility, it means 95% shift coverage instead of 80%. For us, it means manufacturing customers renew — and expand. We're not just giving them software. We're giving them a factory that runs itself.

## Writing Principles

1. **Detailed** — Specific numbers, specific interactions, specific outcomes
2. **Opinionated** — "This is how it should work" not "This could potentially work"
3. **User-centric** — Start and end with the person, not the technology
4. **Emotionally resonant** — The reader should feel something
5. **Concise** — Each part should be 1-2 paragraphs, not a page

## Getting Buy-In with Narratives

Different audiences respond to different framings:

| Audience | Lead With | Close With |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Executives | Business impact + market opportunity | Revenue projection |
| Engineering | Technical challenge + user pain | Clear requirements |
| Sales | Customer quotes + competitive win | Positioning story |
| Design | User journey + emotional moments | Experience vision |

## Common Mistakes

- **Too abstract** — "Improve the employee experience" says nothing
- **Too technical** — "Leverage our microservices architecture" loses non-technical readers
- **No opinion** — "We could do A or B" is a discussion, not a vision
- **No emotion** — Pure logic doesn't inspire action
- **Too long** — A vision narrative is not a spec; keep it to one page
