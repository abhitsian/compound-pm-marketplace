# Strategy Craft Skill

## Purpose

Strategy is a function of segmentation and differentiation. This skill provides the frameworks for both, plus the connective tissue that turns analysis into a strategy document that actually drives decisions.

Based on Shreyas Doshi's strategy framework and Hamilton Helmer's 7 Powers.

## Core Principle

> Strategy is about making choices that are hard to reverse and create compounding advantages.

Good strategy has three properties:
1. **It says no.** If your strategy doesn't reject opportunities, it's not a strategy.
2. **It's different.** If a competitor could write the same strategy, it's not differentiated.
3. **It compounds.** Each decision makes the next decision easier.

## Segmentation Framework

### The Rule: Needs Over Demographics

Segment by what users NEED and DO, not who they ARE.

**Good segmentation dimensions (in priority order):**
1. **Needs-based:** What specific problems do they need solved?
2. **Behavioral:** How do they currently solve the problem?
3. **Context of use:** What environment are they operating in?

**Bad segmentation dimensions:**
- Demographics (age, gender, location) — too broad, don't predict behavior
- Psychographics (personality types) — unmeasurable, untargetable
- Composite personas (marketing fiction) — combine segments that behave differently

### 5-Point Validation Test

Every segment must pass ALL five:

| Test | Question |
|------|----------|
| **Consistent needs** | Do members share similar needs distinct from other segments? |
| **Product-specific** | Is this relevant to YOUR product, not just the market? |
| **Targetable** | Can you predictably find and reach these people? |
| **Prioritizable** | Can you rank segments meaningfully? |
| **Winnable** | Can you realistically serve them better than alternatives? |

### Segment Scoring

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Reach** | How large is the segment? |
| **Underserved degree** | How poorly served by current alternatives? |
| **Differentiation potential** | Can you build something meaningfully better for them? |
| **Ease of targeting** | Can you find and reach them efficiently? |

## Differentiation Framework

### Differentiation is a function of:
1. **User needs** — What the priority segment actually needs
2. **Alternatives** — What they currently use (including "do nothing")
3. **Unique assets** — What you have that others don't
4. **Industry direction** — Where the market is heading
5. **Creative choices** — Non-obvious design decisions
6. **Chosen segments** — Who you've decided to serve

### 7 Powers (Hamilton Helmer)

| Power | Definition | How to Build It |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **Scale Economies** | Unit cost declines with volume | Invest in infrastructure that amortizes |
| **Network Effects** | Value increases with more users | Build features where more users = better product |
| **Switching Costs** | Users face cost to leave | Make your product hold important user data, integrations, workflows |
| **Branding** | Higher perceived value for your brand | Consistent quality, emotional connection, community |
| **Cornered Resource** | Exclusive access to valuable input | Proprietary data, key hires, exclusive partnerships |
| **Counter-Positioning** | New model incumbents can't adopt | Build something that would cannibalize competitors' core business |
| **Process Power** | Organization capabilities that can't be copied | Deep domain expertise, operational excellence, culture |

### Differentiation Classification

| Type | What It Means | Priority |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Differentiator** | Users choose us BECAUSE of this | Invest heavily |
| **MMR** | Users reject us WITHOUT this | Build to parity |
| **Neutralizer** | Removes a reason to NOT choose us | Build to "good enough" |

## Strategy Template

### One-Sentence Strategy
> "[Product] wins by [differentiation] for [segments] against [alternatives]."

Must be: specific, choosy, actionable, falsifiable.

### Full Strategy Structure

1. **One-sentence strategy**
2. **Target segments** — Who we serve, who we don't, and why
3. **Market context & map** — Where the market is headed, who the players are
4. **Strategic pillars (2-6)** — The bets that define our differentiation
5. **Non-priorities** — What we're deliberately NOT doing (the most important section)
6. **1-2 year roadmap** — Now/Next/Later with metrics
7. **Leading & lagging indicators** — 2-4 metrics that tell us if the strategy is working

### Non-Priorities Framework

The most important part of strategy:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Trade-offs** | "We choose X over Y because..." |
| **Lower priority** | "We acknowledge Z matters but won't invest because..." |
| **Table stakes** | "We'll maintain parity on [features] but won't differentiate here" |
| **Below table stakes** | "Competitors do [X] and we deliberately don't because..." |
| **Reassessment triggers** | "We'd reprioritize if [specific market change]" |

## Strategy Stress Test

Before finalizing any strategy, pass these 5 tests:

1. **Is it a real strategy?** Does it make hard choices, or does it say "we'll do everything"?
2. **Can you say no with it?** Give an example of an opportunity you'd reject.
3. **Is it differentiated?** Could a competitor write the same strategy?
4. **Is it achievable?** Do you have the resources and capabilities?
5. **Is it measurable?** Can you tell in 6 months if it's working?
