# Product Riff Skill

## Purpose

Build product sense by actively exploring product news, launches, and announcements from multiple angles. This isn't passive reading — it's structured exploration that forces you to form opinions, challenge assumptions, and extract transferable lessons.

The riff format is deliberately quick (15-20 min) compared to a full teardown. It's designed for the daily cadence of staying sharp on product news.

## The Eight Angles

Every product announcement can be explored from these angles. You don't need all eight every time — pick the 3-4 most relevant.

### 1. The Strategic "Why"

**Core question:** Why did they do this, and why now?

- **Timing:** What changed in the market, their business, or their technology to make this possible or necessary now?
- **Strategic play:** Is this offensive (creating new advantage) or defensive (responding to pressure)?
- **What it reveals:** What does this tell you about their internal priorities, roadmap, and where they're headed?
- **The move behind the move:** What are they setting up for next? This announcement is rarely the endgame.

**Frameworks to apply:** 7 Powers, counter-positioning, platform strategy

### 2. User Impact

**Core question:** Who does this actually help, and who gets hurt?

- **Winners:** Which user segments benefit? How much does their life improve?
- **Losers:** Who gets disrupted, displaced, or forced to change behavior?
- **Adoption equation:** Is motivation high enough to overcome the friction of switching?
- **The non-obvious user:** Beyond the obvious target, who else is affected? (Developers, admins, partners, the users' users)

**Frameworks to apply:** Motivation types, friction analysis, segment analysis

### 3. Competitive Ripple

**Core question:** What does this force everyone else to do?

- **Direct competitors:** Do they need to respond? With what? How fast?
- **Adjacent players:** Does this expand or compress their market?
- **The "why can't they just copy it" test:** What's defensible here? (Network effects, data moats, switching costs, brand, process power)
- **Asymmetric response:** If a competitor responds, does the original move get stronger or weaker?

**Frameworks to apply:** 7 Powers, differentiation classification (differentiator/MMR/neutralizer)

### 4. Business Model Lens

**Core question:** How does this make or save money?

- **Revenue play:** New revenue stream, expansion, retention, or CAC reduction?
- **Pricing signal:** What does the pricing/packaging tell you about their strategy?
- **Growth loop:** Does this create, strengthen, or close a growth loop?
- **Unit economics:** Does this improve or hurt their unit economics? (More users at lower margin? Fewer users at higher margin?)

**Frameworks to apply:** Growth loops, retention mechanics, monetization strategy

### 5. Second-Order Effects

**Core question:** What happens next because of this?

- **1st order:** [announcement] causes [direct effect]
- **2nd order:** Because of 1st order, [what changes in the ecosystem?]
- **3rd order:** Because of 2nd order, [what breaks, emerges, or accelerates?]
- **"Who didn't expect this?"** Think about the stakeholders (regulators, partners, developers, investors) who now have to react.

### 6. Contrarian Take

**Core question:** Why might everyone be wrong about this?

- **The bear case:** What would need to be true for this to fail?
- **Hype vs. substance:** Is the reaction proportional to the actual impact?
- **Hidden costs:** What are they giving up to do this? (Focus, simplicity, existing user satisfaction, engineering resources)
- **Survivorship bias:** Are we only looking at this because they're successful? Would we notice if a smaller company did the same?

### 7. Steal This

**Core question:** What would you take from this for your own product?

- **The transferable insight:** Not the feature, but the underlying principle
- **The application:** How would this principle manifest in your context?
- **The constraint check:** What's different about your situation that changes the calculus?
- **The anti-lesson:** What should you explicitly NOT copy, and why?

### 8. Pattern Match

**Core question:** Have you seen this play before?

- **Historical parallels:** What past product moves rhyme with this one?
- **What happened then:** How did the parallel play out? (Success, failure, unexpected twist)
- **The rhyme vs. the repeat:** What's similar, and what's importantly different?
- **Category patterns:** Is this a known archetype? (Platform play, bundling, unbundling, vertical integration, horizontal expansion, going upmarket, going downmarket)

## Riff Quality Indicators

A good riff:
- Has at least one opinion that could be wrong (you took a stance)
- Identifies something non-obvious (beyond the press release narrative)
- Connects the announcement to broader patterns
- Produces at least one "steal this" insight for your own product
- Surfaces a question you can't answer yet (intellectual honesty)

A bad riff:
- Just summarizes the announcement
- Only has positive takes (or only negative)
- Doesn't connect to anything beyond the announcement itself
- Has no transferable insights
- Doesn't acknowledge uncertainty

## Pattern Library

Over time, riffs build a library of strategic patterns:

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Platform play** | Opening up to third parties | Shopify apps, Slack integrations |
| **Bundling** | Combining separate products | Microsoft 365, Apple One |
| **Unbundling** | Extracting a feature into a product | Figma from Adobe, Notion from Confluence |
| **Going upmarket** | Moving toward enterprise | Slack, Zoom, Notion |
| **Going downmarket** | Moving toward SMB/consumer | HubSpot free tier, Canva |
| **Vertical integration** | Owning more of the stack | Apple silicon, Stripe Atlas |
| **Category creation** | Defining a new market | Figma (collaborative design), Linear (opinionated PM) |
| **Counter-positioning** | Model incumbents can't copy | Basecamp vs Salesforce, Linear vs Jira |
| **Land and expand** | Free/cheap entry, grow usage | Datadog, Twilio |
| **Aggregation** | Owning demand, commoditizing supply | Google, Uber, Airbnb |

## How This Skill Gets Used

This skill is loaded as context by:
- `/pm:riff` — The primary riffing workflow
- `/pm:differentiate` — When analyzing competitive moves
- `/pm:strategy` — When incorporating market context
- `/pm:teardown` — When a teardown is prompted by news

It connects to:
- `strategy-craft` — For 7 Powers and differentiation frameworks
- `simulation` — For user impact modeling
- `growth-systems` — For business model and growth loop analysis
- `analytical-thinking` — For structured reasoning patterns
