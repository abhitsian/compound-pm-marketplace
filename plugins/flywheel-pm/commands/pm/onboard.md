# PM Onboarding — Create Your Personalized Profile

## Purpose

Create a `pm-profile.yaml` that captures your PM operating system — frameworks, vocabulary, past patterns, and preferences. Every future command reads this profile to personalize its output.

## Input

<pm_docs> #$ARGUMENTS </pm_docs>

## Step 1: Check for Existing Profile

```bash
ls pm-profile.yaml 2>/dev/null
```

**If profile exists:** Ask whether to update or start fresh.

**If no profile:** Proceed to Step 2.

## Step 2: Choose Onboarding Mode

Use **AskUserQuestion tool**:

**Question:** "How would you like to set up your PM profile?"

**Options:**
1. **Import from documents** — Point me to your PM docs, operating system decks, or past specs and I'll extract your frameworks
2. **Interactive Q&A** — I'll ask questions to understand how you work
3. **Start minimal** — Create a basic profile and let it build over time through usage

## Step 3a: Import Mode

If the user provided a file path in `$ARGUMENTS` or selects import:

1. Read the provided documents (PDF, markdown, or text)
2. Run the **pm-profile-analyzer** agent to extract:
   - Frameworks used (opportunity evaluation, metrics, solution classification)
   - Vocabulary preferences (what they call things)
   - Metric patterns from past projects
   - Decision-making approach
   - Leadership and stakeholder style
3. Present extracted profile for review
4. Ask: "Does this capture how you work? What should I adjust?"

## Step 3b: Interactive Mode

Ask questions **one at a time** using **AskUserQuestion tool**:

### Identity
- "What's your PM domain?" (B2B SaaS, B2C, Platform, Marketplace, etc.)
- "What level do you operate at?" (IC PM, Senior PM, PM Lead/Manager, Director+)

### Opportunity Evaluation
- "When evaluating a new opportunity, what do you start with?"
  - Business outcome first (revenue, retention, then find the customer problem)
  - Customer problem first (find the pain, then map to business outcome)
  - Data insight first (find the signal, then investigate)
  - Competitive pressure first (market forces, then strategic response)

### Solution Design
- "How do you classify solutions when prioritizing?"
  - Differentiator / MMR / Neutralizer
  - Impact vs Effort (2x2 matrix)
  - RICE scoring
  - Custom framework

### Metrics
- "How do you structure your metrics hierarchy?"
  - Outcome → Intermediate → Leading
  - North Star → L1 → L2
  - Business → Product → Feature
  - Custom

### Activation
- "How do you define user activation?"
  - Setup → Aha → Habit
  - Onboarding → First Value → Retention
  - Custom funnel

### Engagement
- "How do you segment engaged users?"
  - Casual / Core / Power
  - DAU / WAU / MAU ratios
  - Feature adoption tiers
  - Custom

### Stakeholders
- "Who are your key stakeholder types?"
  - Engineering, Design, Research, Sales, Marketing, Leadership, etc.
- "What buy-in techniques work in your org?"
  - Data-driven arguments
  - Vision narratives
  - Social proof from customers
  - Executive sponsorship
  - Cross-team workshops

## Step 3c: Minimal Mode

Create a skeleton profile with defaults. It will enrich through usage.

## Step 4: Generate Profile

Create `pm-profile.yaml` with the collected information:

```yaml
# PM Profile — Auto-generated by /pm:onboard
# This file is read by every /pm: command and updated by /pm:compound

name: "[PM Name]"
role: "[Role]"
domain: "[Domain]"
experience_level: "[Level]"
created: "YYYY-MM-DD"
last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"

# Preferred frameworks
frameworks:
  opportunity_evaluation: "[approach]"
  solution_classification: "[approach]"
  metrics_hierarchy: "[approach]"
  activation_funnel: "[stages]"
  user_segmentation: "[approach]"
  engagement_metrics: "[dimensions]"
  buy_in_techniques: ["[technique1]", "[technique2]"]

# Vocabulary — what you call things
vocabulary:
  primary_metric_term: "[outcome metric / north star / etc.]"
  problem_framing: "[HMW / problem statement / job-to-be-done]"
  roadmap_lens: ["[lens1]", "[lens2]"]

# Past project patterns — grows with each /pm:compound
project_patterns: []

# Learned thresholds — calibrated from predictions vs actuals
thresholds: {}

# Decision log — grows with each /pm:compound
decision_log: []

# Stakeholder landscape
stakeholders: {}
```

## Step 5: Confirm and Save

Write the file to `pm-profile.yaml` in the project root.

Present:
```
Profile created at pm-profile.yaml

Your PM operating system is now encoded. Every /pm: command will adapt to your frameworks.

What's next?
1. Run /pm:opportunity — Start evaluating an opportunity
2. Run /pm:solution — Design solutions for a known opportunity
3. Edit profile — Adjust anything manually
4. Done for now
```

## Profile Growth Over Time

After each `/pm:compound`, the profile gains:
- New entries in `project_patterns` with metric predictions vs actuals
- Updated `thresholds` calibrated from real outcomes
- New entries in `decision_log` with outcomes
- Refined `frameworks` based on what the PM actually uses vs. skips
