# Flywheel PM — Cheat Sheet

## First Time Setup
```
/pm:welcome              # Guided first-run experience
/pm:onboard              # Create your PM profile
/pm:context              # Load your work environment
```

## Skill Development
```
/pm:teardown             # Product teardown (simulation muscle)
/pm:simulate             # Predict user reactions before shipping
/pm:bias-check           # Check decisions for cognitive biases
/pm:friction-log         # Structured friction logging
/pm:wayrtd               # "What Are You Really Trying To Do?"
/pm:motivation-map       # Map adoption equation (motivation, friction, nudge, satisfaction)
/pm:ux-psychology        # Apply behavioral design to flows
```

## Strategy
```
/pm:segment              # Needs-based segmentation (not demographics)
/pm:differentiate        # Competitive differentiation (7 Powers)
/pm:strategy             # Full strategy doc (pillars, non-priorities, roadmap)
```

## Research & Discovery
```
/pm:research             # Ingest customer signals (support, NPS, sales, usage)
/pm:interview            # Prepare → Interview → Debrief → Synthesize
```

## The Core Loop
```
/pm:opportunity          # Signal → Problem → Business context → HMW
/pm:solution             # 20 creativity techniques → Risk/Impact → Classification
/pm:spec                 # Vision narrative → Journey → Metrics → Launch criteria
/pm:review               # 5+ agents review in parallel → P1/P2/P3 findings
/pm:measure              # Predictions → Activation funnel → Continue/Pause/Pivot
/pm:compound             # Predictions vs actuals → Profile update → Team share
```

## Growth & Metrics
```
/pm:growth-model         # Map growth loops (acquisition, engagement, monetization)
/pm:retention            # Retention curves, habit loops, resurrection strategies
/pm:north-star           # Design NSM with ecosystem analysis and guardrails
/pm:goals                # Set team goals from NSM (the altitude shift)
/pm:tradeoff             # Structured tradeoff analysis with evidence
```

## Anytime Commands
```
/pm:decide               # Options → Criteria → Pre-mortem → Log
/pm:buyin                # Stakeholder-specific narratives (6 techniques)
/pm:product-review       # Weekly review for team / leadership / all-hands
/pm:context update       # Refresh your operating environment
/pm:share                # Promote a learning to team knowledge base
/pm:lfg                  # Full pipeline: opportunity → buyin (one command)
```

## Three Files That Matter
```
pm-profile.yaml          # How YOU think (auto-enriched by /pm:compound)
team-profile.yaml        # What the TEAM knows (built by /pm:share)
work-context.yaml        # What you're WORKING ON (refreshed by /pm:context)
```

## The Two Rules
```
1. Never skip /pm:compound. That's where the artifact gains accumulate.
2. Practice /pm:teardown regularly. That's where the judgment gains accumulate.
```

## Weekly Rhythm
```
Monday:     /pm:context update → /pm:product-review
Anytime:    /pm:interview → /pm:research → /pm:opportunity
Big calls:  /pm:decide → /pm:bias-check → /pm:buyin
Before ship: /pm:simulate → /pm:motivation-map
Friday:     /pm:product-review → /pm:compound
Weekend:    /pm:teardown (build the muscle)
```

## Two Layers of Compounding
```
Artifact Compounding (v1.0):
  Cycle 1:   Generic frameworks. Predictions are guesses.
  Cycle 5:   Pre-filled thresholds. Past patterns referenced.
  Cycle 10:  Estimation bias known. Past failures flagged.

Judgment Compounding (v2.0):
  Teardown 1:  Surface-level analysis. Many blind spots.
  Teardown 5:  Plugin shows you consistently miss social motivation.
  Teardown 10: Your simulation accuracy by segment type is tracked.
  Teardown 20: Plugin mirrors how you think — and where you're wrong.
