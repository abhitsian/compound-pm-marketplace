# Solution Creativity Skill

## Purpose

Provide systematic creativity techniques for generating product solutions. These 20 techniques ensure you explore the full solution space instead of jumping to the first idea.

## 20 Creativity Techniques

### Group 1: Constraint Manipulation

| # | Technique | How to Apply |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Add constraints** | What if you could only use one screen? One click? No text? |
| 2 | **Remove constraints** | What if there were no technical limitations? No budget limits? |
| 3 | **Make it much bigger** | What if this served 100x the users? What changes? |
| 4 | **Make it much smaller** | What's the absolute minimum that delivers value? |

### Group 2: Structural Manipulation

| # | Technique | How to Apply |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 5 | **Bundle** | What separate things should be combined into one? |
| 6 | **Unbundle** | What combined thing should be broken apart? |
| 7 | **Make it the only thing** | What if the entire product was just this feature? |
| 8 | **Make it unnecessary** | Can you eliminate the need entirely? |

### Group 3: User Psychology

| # | Technique | How to Apply |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 9 | **Remove friction** | What steps can be eliminated or automated? |
| 10 | **Add friction** | Where would intentional friction improve outcomes? |
| 11 | **Reduce anxiety** | What worries users? How do you address that fear? |
| 12 | **Solve an unexpressed need** | What do users need but haven't articulated? |

### Group 4: Perspective Shifts

| # | Technique | How to Apply |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 13 | **Do the opposite** | What if you reversed every assumption? |
| 14 | **Reframe** | What if the problem is actually something different? |
| 15 | **Combine unrelated things** | What unexpected combination creates value? |
| 16 | **Solve multiple problems** | Can one solution address 2-3 pain points? |

### Group 5: Experience Design

| # | Technique | How to Apply |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 17 | **Surprise** | What would unexpectedly delight users? |
| 18 | **Make them feel smarter** | How can the product make users look good? |
| 19 | **Build distribution in** | How can the product spread itself through use? |
| 20 | **Make it skeuomorphic** | What real-world metaphor fits perfectly? |

## How to Use

### Quick Mode (5 minutes)
Pick 3-4 techniques most relevant to the problem. Generate one idea per technique.

### Deep Mode (30 minutes)
Run all 20 techniques. Generate 1-2 ideas per technique. Then cluster and evaluate.

### Workshop Mode (1-2 hours)
Run all 20 techniques in groups. For each group, discuss the best idea. Then combine ideas across groups.

## Solution Evaluation

After generating candidates, evaluate each on four dimensions:

| Dimension | Question | Validation Method |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| **Valuable** | Will customers find this valuable? | Painted doors, interviews |
| **Usable** | Can customers use this easily? | Prototype testing |
| **Feasible** | Can we build this? | Engineering spikes |
| **Viable** | Will this achieve the business outcome? | GTM validation |

## Classification

After evaluation, classify each solution:

- **Differentiator** — Unique competitive advantage
- **MMR** — Must-have to compete
- **Neutralizer** — Catches up to competitors
- **Quick Win** — Low effort, moderate value

Then plot on the Risk vs Impact 2x2:
- No Brainers (low risk, high impact) → Do first
- Big Bets (high risk, high impact) → Invest carefully
- Quick Wins (low risk, low impact) → Fill gaps
- Duds (high risk, low impact) → Avoid
