# Opportunity Evaluation Skill

## Purpose

Provide structured frameworks for evaluating product opportunities from raw signals to prioritized initiatives.

## Customer Problem Framework

### 5-Question Framework

1. **What is the problem?**
   - State the observable pain, not the assumed solution
   - Use specific language: "Users spend 47 minutes/week manually copying data between tools"
   - Not: "Users need better integration"

2. **Who are we solving it for?**
   - Specific persona with context
   - Their constraints, capabilities, environment
   - Segment size and accessibility

3. **How does it impact strategy?**
   - Connection to growth model (acquisition, activation, engagement, retention, monetization)
   - Connection to product vision
   - Connection to competitive positioning

4. **How do we know this is a problem?**
   - Data evidence (metrics, support tickets, usage patterns)
   - Qualitative evidence (user interviews, customer feedback)
   - Market evidence (competitor moves, industry trends)

5. **Why do we think this is happening?**
   - Root cause hypothesis (not symptom)
   - Contributing factors
   - What would need to change

### Signal Types

| Type | Starts With | Investigation Direction |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| User insight | What (observed behavior) | Validate: Is this a real problem? Find: Who, where, why |
| Data insight | Where (metric anomaly) | Investigate: What's causing it? Find: What, who, why |
| Competitive | External pressure | Assess: Is this relevant? Decide: React or ignore |
| Strategic | Business direction | Map: What customer problem aligns? |

## Business Context Evaluation

### Three Dimensions

**Monetization Potential:**
- Direct revenue opportunity (new revenue, expansion, upsell)
- Indirect revenue (retention improvement, reduced CAC)
- Quantify with methodology, not just "high/medium/low"

**Strategic Fit:**
- Vision alignment (does this take us where we want to go?)
- Platform leverage (does this enable other products/features?)
- Defensibility (Hamilton 7 Powers: scale economies, switching costs, cornered resource, counter positioning, branding, network effects, process power)

**Competitive Pressure:**
- What are competitors doing in this space?
- Market timing (early, on-time, late)
- Risk of inaction

## Prioritization

### Impact Assessment

| Factor | Question |
|--------|---------|
| Impact potential | How big is the expected return? |
| Time to return | How quickly will we see results? |
| Compounding vs linear | Does this enable future bets or is it one-time value? |
| Multi-outcome impact | Does it serve multiple business objectives? |
| Order of operations | Must this happen before other things can? |

### Differentiation Classification

| Type | Definition | Implication |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Differentiator** | Unique advantage competitors don't have | Build and market aggressively |
| **MMR** | Minimum market requirement to compete | Must have but don't over-invest |
| **Neutralizer** | Catches up to competitor advantage | Build to parity, not beyond |

### Risk vs Impact Matrix

- **High Risk, High Impact** → Big Bets (invest if strategically important)
- **Low Risk, High Impact** → No Brainers (do these first)
- **Low Risk, Low Impact** → Quick Wins (fill in gaps)
- **High Risk, Low Impact** → Duds (avoid)

## HMW Framing

Good HMW statements are:
- **Specific enough** to guide solution design
- **Broad enough** to allow creative solutions
- **Focused on outcome**, not implementation

Examples:
- Good: "How might we enable deskless workers to resolve IT issues without a desktop computer?"
- Too broad: "How might we improve the employee experience?"
- Too narrow: "How might we add a mobile app for factory workers?"
