# Decision log — grows with each /pm:decide and /pm:compound
decision_log:
  - date: "2023-05-15"
    feature: "Deskless Workers"
    decision: "Prioritize kiosk over mobile app"
    rationale: "Factory workers can't carry phones on floor; kiosk at break room has higher reach"
    outcome: "Correct — kiosk adoption was 3x projected. Mobile added later as fast-follow."
    would_decide_differently: "No"

  - date: "2024-02-01"
    feature: "Task Center"
    decision: "Build as platform component vs. standalone feature"
    rationale: "Task data creates a unique dataset (work graph) that benefits other products"
    outcome: "Correct — work graph became foundation for future roadmap"
    would_decide_differently: "No"

  - date: "2024-07-01"
    feature: "Targeted Communications"
    decision: "Limit MVP to service owners, not corporate comms"
    rationale: "Service owner pain is immediate and measurable; corp comms is broader but vaguer"
    outcome: "Correct — focused MVP drove adoption. Corp comms added in V2."
    would_decide_differently: "No, but would have planned V2 scope earlier"

# Framework notes — meta-learnings about the frameworks themselves
framework_notes:
  - "Activation funnel (setup/aha/habit) works well for B2B employee-facing products"
  - "Revenue predictions tend to be conservative by ~12% — consider adjusting upward"
  - "User segmentation (casual/core/power) maps well to enterprise engagement patterns"
  - "For new personas: focus on service owner/admin activation before end-user engagement"
  - "Governance model is often the hidden blocker for platform adoption — always investigate"
  - "Differentiator classification correlates with better revenue outcomes than MMR"
  - "Stakeholder buy-in with inception technique works best for cross-team initiatives"
