# Stakeholder Buy-In Skill

## Purpose

Provide structured techniques for getting stakeholder alignment on product initiatives. These techniques work because they address how people actually make decisions, not how they say they make decisions.

## Six Buy-In Techniques

### 1. Framing
**What it is:** Steering the audience to a desired conclusion by controlling the context.

**How to use:**
- Lead with shared goals ("We all agree retention is priority one...")
- Present data that naturally points to your conclusion
- Frame alternatives as less aligned with stated priorities
- Control the comparison set (compare to the right things)

**When to use:** When the data supports your direction but stakeholders haven't connected the dots.

**Example:** "Our retention goal is 90%. Non-ITSM teams are at 65%. Closing this gap represents $10M in protected revenue. The question isn't whether to invest — it's where to start."

### 2. Social Proof
**What it is:** Leveraging shared opinions and external validation to build confidence.

**How to use:**
- "3 of our top 5 customers have independently asked for this"
- "Competitor X and Y have both moved in this direction"
- Reference internal allies who support the initiative
- Show industry trends and analyst perspectives

**When to use:** When stakeholders are uncertain and need reassurance that others agree.

### 3. Goal Seek
**What it is:** Framing your initiative in terms of the decision-maker's stated goals.

**How to use:**
- Map your initiative directly to their OKRs
- Show how it helps THEM succeed, not just the product
- Use their language and metrics
- Frame it as enabling their vision

**When to use:** When you need buy-in from someone whose goals are adjacent to yours.

**Example:** "VP Sales wants to increase ACV by 15%. This feature opens a new SKU conversation in every renewal. It's not a product feature — it's a sales weapon."

### 4. Inception
**What it is:** Making stakeholders feel ownership of the idea.

**How to use:**
- Run cross-team workshops where the idea emerges from discussion
- Reference past conversations: "Building on what you said last quarter about..."
- Ask leading questions that guide them to the conclusion
- Credit them publicly for the direction

**When to use:** When direct pitching meets resistance. Some people need to feel they discovered the idea.

**Warning:** This takes longer but produces stronger alignment. Use it for initiatives where ongoing collaboration is needed.

### 5. Citation
**What it is:** Using data and evidence to support the argument.

**How to use:**
- Lead with quantitative evidence (metrics, revenue projections)
- Support with qualitative evidence (customer quotes, support tickets)
- Reference industry benchmarks and best practices
- Show A/B test results or prototype feedback

**When to use:** When stakeholders are analytical and need proof before committing.

### 6. Narration
**What it is:** Using stories and anecdotes to make the initiative tangible.

**How to use:**
- Tell a specific customer story that illustrates the problem
- Walk through the before/after user journey
- Use the vision narrative (Part 1 → Part 2 → Part 3)
- Make it personal — "Imagine you're Maria, on the factory floor..."

**When to use:** When stakeholders need to feel the problem, not just see the data.

## Matching Technique to Audience

| Stakeholder Type | Primary Technique | Secondary Technique |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Visionary** (CEO, CPO) | Narration | Framing |
| **Executor** (VP Eng, CTO) | Citation | Goal Seek |
| **Process-Driven** (Program, Compliance) | Goal Seek | Social Proof |
| **Customer-Facing** (Sales, CS) | Narration | Social Proof |
| **Skeptic** (Finance, Legal) | Citation | Framing |
| **Resistant** (competing priorities) | Inception | Goal Seek |

## Combining Techniques

The most effective buy-in uses 2-3 techniques together:

1. **Open with Narration** — Make them feel the problem
2. **Support with Citation** — Back it up with data
3. **Close with Goal Seek** — Show how it helps them personally

## Common Mistakes

- **Leading with the solution** — Start with the problem, not your idea
- **Ignoring politics** — Every org has power dynamics; map them first
- **One-size-fits-all** — Different stakeholders need different narratives
- **Skipping inception** — Some people will never support an idea they didn't help create
- **Data without story** — Numbers alone don't motivate action
- **Story without data** — Anecdotes alone don't justify investment
